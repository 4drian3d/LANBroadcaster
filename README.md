# LANBroadcaster
LANBroadcaster, originally created by [Ruan](https://gitlab.com/ruany/) allows a Minecraft 
server to be broadcasted over the local area network and appear in the LAN server list without actually adding it.

## Why this version?
The original LANBroadcaster, by Ruan has support for Spigot and BungeeCord, however this version adds support 
for [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org/) and [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/).

## Getting Started
LANBroadcaster can be downloaded from the releases tab [here]().

Once it is downloaded, simply place it in the relevant plugins
folder and start your server. No configuration is required.

> Note: To use LANBroadcaster with BungeeCord or Velocity, you do not need to install it on the servers itself. Only the proxy.
